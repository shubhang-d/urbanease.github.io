# Urban Ease
This is a dummy furniture ecommerce website which was made by me(Shubhang Dixit) and my Team(Suryanash Agrawal, Sanskar Khandelwal, Shubh Singhal, and Shailesh Gole). It was developed as a project given by our trainer.

Link to the Website: https://shubhang-d.github.io/urbanease.github.io/

It consists of 
- A beautifully designed Home Page with a navigation bar and some good animations on button click.
